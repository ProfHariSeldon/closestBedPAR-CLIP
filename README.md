# closestBedPAR-CLIP
To plot distance histograms of protein binding sites to all types of pre-RNA junctions (intron-exon and exon-intron, etc.), closestBed requires post-processing to isolate pertinent information, limit results to flanking regions, and not double-count with the histogram if the regions are short.  Also ngs.plot.r is used to create exon and genebody distance graphs.
